## 🧠 About Me

I'm a fullstack engineer who obsesses over the full picture — from pixel-perfect frontends to bulletproof backends. Working remotely gives me the freedom to collaborate with teams and clients across the globe, bringing clean code, smart architecture, and real-world impact to every project.

Whether it's crafting a delightful UI, designing a scalable API, or automating a CI/CD pipeline at midnight with a coffee in hand, I'm all in.

> *"Nothing beats the thrill of a smooth deployment or cracking a tough bug — remote work just makes it all the sweeter."*

## 🛠️ My Favorite Technologies

The tools I reach for day after day to ship robust, modern web apps:

### Frontend
![Next.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Next.js-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=nextdotjs&logoColor=white)
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB)
![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-3178C6?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)
![Tailwind CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tailwind_CSS-06B6D4?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwindcss&logoColor=white)

**Next.js & React** — Server-side rendering, static generation, SEO magic, and a component model that keeps things modular and a joy to build.

**Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first styling that turns "make it responsive and beautiful" from a chore into a superpower.

**TypeScript (TSX)** — Because catching errors at compile time beats debugging at 2am. Type safety is not optional for me.

---

### Backend & Data
![Django](https://img.shields.io/badge/Django-092E20?style=for-the-badge&logo=django&logoColor=white)
![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-4169E1?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)

**Django** — Batteries-included and battle-tested. Auth, ORM, admin panel, and security baked right in. My go-to for APIs that need to scale.

**PostgreSQL** — Reliability, JSON support, full-text search, and rock-solid performance. Postgres handles whatever I throw at it.

---

### DevOps & Infrastructure
![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-2496ED?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white)
![Kubernetes](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kubernetes-326CE5?style=for-the-badge&logo=kubernetes&logoColor=white)
![GitHub Actions](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub_Actions-2088FF?style=for-the-badge&logo=githubactions&logoColor=white)

**Docker** — Consistent environments from dev to prod. "Works on my machine" is not in my vocabulary.

**Kubernetes** — When scale and resilience matter, K8s keeps the ship running no matter the load.

**GitHub Actions** — Automated CI/CD pipelines, test runners, and deployments that let me ship with confidence and zero manual drudgery.
