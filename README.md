### Hey, I’m Dennis 👋

I’m a fullstack software engineer passionate about building web applications that solve problems and create great user experiences. From frontend flair to backend horsepower, I love crafting end-to-end solutions remotely—giving me the flexibility to collaborate with clients and teams worldwide. Clean code, smart design, and impactful results are my driving forces.

#### My Favorite Technologies
I’ve got a toolkit of go-to technologies that I use to build robust, modern web apps. Here’s what I love working with and why they rock:

- **NextJS & ReactJS**: For fast, dynamic frontends, NextJS’s server-side rendering and static generation deliver speed and SEO magic. React’s component-based structure keeps things modular and fun to build.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling made simple. Tailwind’s utility-first approach lets me whip up responsive, pixel-perfect designs without the CSS clutter—efficiency at its finest.
- **TSX (TypeScript + JSX)**: Type safety meets React goodness. I lean on TypeScript to catch errors early, making my code cleaner and more reliable.
- **Django**: My backend weapon of choice. Django’s secure, scalable framework—complete with auth, ORM, and admin tools—speeds up development while keeping things solid.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerhouse database I adore. Its reliability, advanced features (like JSON support), and scalability make it perfect for handling complex data with ease.
- **Docker**: Containers are my deployment BFF. Docker ensures consistency across environments, making remote workflows seamless and stress-free.
- **Kubernetes (K8s)**: For projects that demand scale and resilience, K8s handles the heavy lifting—keeping apps humming no matter the load.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automation at its best. I use it to streamline CI/CD pipelines, run tests, and deploy with confidence—saving time and keeping quality high.
